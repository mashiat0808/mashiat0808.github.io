                   As a child, I developed a passion for solving problems and have always been drawn to challenges. This love for problem-solving eventually led me to discover sudoku, a puzzle game that has captivated me for years. I have even won awards for my skills in sudoku, which has only further fueled my love for this game.

        In college, my interests expanded to include photography and event management. I enjoyed the creative aspect of photography and the thrill of coordinating events. While I may not be a professional in these areas, they have remained a passion of mine and I continue to pursue them in my free time (the shot of my beautiful department building is taken by me by the way!).
        <br> <br>
       In my free time, I also enjoy drawing and playing music on my guitar (even though I'm not particularly skilled at it). I find that both of these hobbies allow me to express my creativity and relax.<br> <br>
        As technology continues to advance, I find myself increasingly interested in exploring new technology and its various applications. I enjoy learning about the latest gadgets and software and finding new ways to use them.
        <br> <br>
        Finally, if I had it my way, I would ditch traditional schooling and instead focus on self-study and research. I have always been a fast learner, especially when it comes to subjects that I am passionate about, and I believe that self-guided learning can be a very rewarding experience.
        <br> <br>
        In conclusion, my hobbies and passions are diverse and varied, but they all bring me joy and allow me to express myself in unique ways. Thank you for visiting my hobbies page.</p>
